// It used to be built twice -- once by the driver and once by the parity test --
// under a comment claiming they were the same path. They were not, and the copy
// silently dropped two fields in a row: the neuron-memory flag, and then the
// obstacle count. Both times the shader ran with the field at zero while the CPU
// reference ran with it set, so parity reported a numeric drift rather than a
// missing feature, which is a slow way to find a field you forgot to copy.
//
// `resolved` must already have been through resolveStepSettings for the step
// being packed; the scenario is looked up from it.
