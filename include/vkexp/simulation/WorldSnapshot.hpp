// The trail field is deliberately not here. It is device-local, it is the

// 2 added the group fitness sharing weight. 3 added neuron time constants: the
// genome, the agent record and the settings all changed shape at once, so a
// version 2 file cannot be reinterpreted into this run under any default. A
// file that predates a setting is not a file that had it turned off, so both
// bumps reject rather than fill in.
// 4 replaced the neuron-memory flag with a three-valued model and grew the
// genome by a gate block, so a version 3 file names a different network.
// 10 changed what a puck's fourth pose slot holds -- the side of the centre line
// it started on became the distance it started from the middle -- and what its
// latched level counts. The record is the same 32 bytes either way, so a version
// 9 file would be read without complaint and report a puck that had travelled a
// journey one metre long as having finished one of length 1.
// 11 added the gate world's latch setting to the physics block and an eleventh
// scenario to the registry: a version 10 file carries neither, and a scenario
// count is one of the things this format refuses to reinterpret.
// 12 added the puck world's friction floor, which decides whether one agent can
// move the puck at all: a version 11 file predates it, and reading it as a floor
// of zero would resume an experiment as a different one.
