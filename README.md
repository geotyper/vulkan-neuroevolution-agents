# Vulkan Neuroevolution Agents

An experimental C++20/Vulkan playground for evolving thousands of small agent
brains on the GPU. The first scenario is deliberately simple: agents use seven
directional photoreceptors to find stationary or periodically changing beacon
positions, while a genetic algorithm evolves the weights of a fixed dense
neural network.

The repository is a working vertical slice and a base for later worlds with
walls, memory, inter-agent light perception, colonies, and richer fitness
functions. Simulation, evolution, visualization, UI, and Vulkan infrastructure
are separate targets rather than one application-specific module.

## Current experiment

The world is metric: one unit is one metre, the step is fixed at 60 Hz, and the
default arena is 3.68 m across with a 4.4 cm body moving at up to 0.55 m/s, so a
900-step trial is 15 seconds. Steps remain the unit of reproducibility -- runs
replay by step count -- while every physical quantity is expressed per second.

- 512 genomes, each evaluated in four trials (2048 GPU agents);
- population partitioned into configurable logical groups (12 agents per world
  by default, with an all-agents mode);
- 7 forward light receptors with RGB and luminance channels;
- 8 full-body tactile sectors distinguishing walls from agents;
- 3 ground antennae reading the RGB of a decaying trail field;
- `61 inputs -> 20 tanh neurons -> 8 outputs`;
- every hidden neuron holds its own state and an evolved time constant, so a
  memory is measured in seconds and reflexes and slow facts separate by
  selection;
- outputs control left/right motors, RGB emission, emission intensity, and two
  recurrent memory cells;
- inertial movement with linear/angular drag and hard linear/angular speed
  limits;
- selectable circular or square world in small (x1), medium (x1.5), and large
  (x3) sizes;
- stationary per-trial beacons, alternating diagonal pairs, orbiting beacons,
  deterministic random movement with occasional teleportation, or an
  orbiting-resource/static-home foraging cycle;
- circle-circle agent collisions with impulse response and tactile pressure;
- configurable fitness penalty per second of contact with the world boundary;
- additive, softly tone-mapped RGB perception of nearby agent signals;
- runtime ablation switches for agent collisions and agent-light perception;
- average fitness across trials rewards progress and completion in every beacon
  phase and penalizes motor and signal energy use;
- elitism, tournament selection, uniform crossover, Gaussian mutation;
- adjustable simulation speed, generation length, agents per world, physics,
  and sensor FOV;
- generation length selectable from 120 to 15000 simulation steps;
- separate simulation, genetic-algorithm, world, and profiler windows;
- fitness/arrival history graphs for completed generations;
- an off-screen Vulkan renderer with persistent circular bodies, heading
  markers, and independently rendered coloured halos.

The population is divided into configurable groups, and each group keeps four
independent trial worlds. With the default group size of 12, 512 genomes occupy
43 groups and 172 logical worlds. A per-world uniform grid limits collision and
light queries to nearby agents in the same world. The viewport renders only the
selected world and can switch between groups and trials. Selecting all 512
agents produces one group and restores the original interaction density while
still avoiding the visual overlap of its four trials.

Individual fitness does not yet reward helping unrelated genomes, so the
communication channel is functional but meaningful signalling is not expected
until colony fitness is introduced.

The four trials are not four independently trained populations. Every genome
controls four agents with the same weights but different initial conditions.
Their scores are averaged before selection, which discourages solutions that
only work from one spawn position or heading.

## World and beacon scenarios

| Control | Variants | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| World shape | Circle, Square | Changes the arena boundary and wall-contact response. |
| World size | Small x1, Medium x1.5, Large x3 | Scales the arena, spawn distribution, and beacon placement. Agent size, speed, and sensor range remain physical constants, so larger worlds are harder. |
| Arrival radius multiplier | x0.1 to x5.0 | Scales the fixed 0.060 beacon radius used for pickup/completion. At x1 the agent centre must enter the visible beacon circle. |
| Beacon scenario | Stationary | One fixed coloured target per logical trial. |
| Beacon scenario | Alternating diagonals | Two beacons occupy one diagonal during the first half of a generation, then two beacons occupy the opposite diagonal. |
| Beacon scenario | Rotating | One beacon per trial continuously orbits the world centre; speed and direction are adjustable from -90 to +90 degrees per second. |
| Beacon scenario | Random movement | Each trial follows a smooth bounded wandering path with adjustable speed and a configurable teleport chance checked every three seconds. |
| Beacon scenario | Forage + home | Agents collect an orange orbiting resource, then carry its decaying value to a blue home that relocates every eight seconds before seeking the resource again. |
| Beacon scenario | Scent relay | The same collect-and-deliver cycle, but home emits no light and lays no trail: it can only be found by dead reckoning or by a path the agents themselves marked. |
| Beacon scenario | Two doors | The same cycle across a wall with two gaps, one of which is a dead end. Which one swaps every trial, and from the home side they are identical. |

Changing the world size, shape, or beacon scenario resets the evolution because
fitness values gathered in different environments are not directly comparable.
In the alternating scenario, reaching either active beacon completes the
current phase. Progress and completion are scored independently for both halves
of the generation. The moving scenarios additionally reward sustained visible
closeness, so following the target scores better than a chance encounter.
Rotating and random scenarios expose an orbit/roaming-radius control; the
default random teleport probability is 25%.

The scent relay is the foraging cycle with the return trip made invisible. The
resource orbits and is lit as before; home sits opposite it and is black, so it
is absent from every light sensor and lays nothing on the ground. What the
agents do leave behind is their own trail, coloured by their own signal output,
which the antennae can read. Nothing in the fitness function mentions colour, so
whether a shared meaning emerges is the experiment rather than the design.

## Two doors

A wall runs across the arena with two gaps in it. One leads through to the
resource; the other opens into a closed pocket. Which gap is the dead end swaps
every trial, and a genome is evaluated on all four trials, so it cannot win by
always turning the same way. The trial index is not among the network's inputs,
so it cannot be read off either -- the only way to know is to have gone.

```
                resource
   +-------------------------------+
   |            #####              |   pocket cap
   |            #   #              |   pocket sides
   |#########  ###########  #######|   the wall, at y = 0
   |         A            B        |
   |                               |
   |             home              |
   +-------------------------------+
```

This is the world the neuron time constants were built for. On an orbiting
beacon there is nothing a memory is *for*, so a fitness curve was the only
evidence and it said nothing about what had been learned. Here there is
something specific to hold across seconds -- which gap was a dead end this
trial -- and something specific to watch for: an agent that blunders into the
pocket once and then goes straight to the other gap looks different from one
that does not.

Both beacons are lit, unlike the scent relay. The question this world asks is
which gap leads through, and an invisible home would stack a second, already
answered question on top of it and make the answer to neither legible.

**Why colour has an incentive here.** An agent that has been into the pocket is
the only one that knows, and it leaves a coloured trail as it comes back out.
Marking the dead end pays its own next cycle back within the same trial, not
only its neighbours' -- so unlike the scent relay, the signalling channel has an
individual incentive that does not depend on turning group fitness sharing on.
Nothing in the fitness function mentions colour; whether a mark acquires a
meaning is still the experiment rather than the design.

**Light is occluded.** A wall that stops a body but not its light is a wall an
agent can see through, and the gradient then pulls it straight at the one place
it cannot go. Occlusion is a slab test on the segment from the agent to the
light, done per beacon and per neighbour rather than per receptor: a light is a
point, so either the line to it is clear or it is not there at all.

That is roughly twelve slab tests per agent per step, beside a brain that
already does more than a thousand multiplies. A lightmap rebuilt each tick
would answer the same question by sampling and would be the right tool for
hundreds of sources over complex geometry; with two beacons and six boxes it is
both slower and coarser, and the receptors are directional -- a map gives the
light at a point and loses the direction the sharp receptor tuning needs, so it
would have to be marched along each ray anyway.

Note what this leaves in place: perception loses the resource behind the wall,
but fitness does not. Progress is still banked against the geometric distance to
the target, so the task stays learnable by shaping while being unsolvable by
looking.

**Geometry.** Six axis-aligned boxes. Thickness is set by the agent and not by
the arena -- one body diameter, 4.4 cm -- because a wall is a wall whatever room
it stands in; scaling it with the world radius made a 17 cm slab across a 3.7 m
arena, nearly four body diameters of masonry that read as architecture rather
than as a divider. Everything else is derived from the arena radius by
`ScenarioKernel.inl` rather than stored, so they cost no parameter slot and the
CPU and the shader cannot disagree about where a wall is. Contact reports
through the same tactile channel the arena boundary uses: to the network a
barrier is a barrier, and no new input had to be found room for. The unit test
sweeps the wall line for a seam between segments, sweeps the pocket boundary for
a way out, and asserts that no barrier is thinner than the distance an agent
covers in one step -- a wall a fast agent steps over between two contact tests
is decoration -- stated against the top of the speed slider and against the box
as the contact test sees it, inflated by the body radius, since a wall that
holds only at default speed is a wall that fails when the experiment is turned
up. Occlusion is asserted as the world rather than as the slab test:
from home the resource is hidden, from the open doorway it is not, and inside
the dead end it is hidden again.

The scenario also places its own spawn: the driver's default spiral covers the
whole arena, which here would start half the population already past the wall
with nothing left to solve.

```sh
vkneuro_headless --scenario doors --generations 200 --seed 5 --csv runs/doors.csv
# and the same run without neuron memory, to see what the time constants bought
vkneuro_headless --scenario doors --generations 200 --seed 5 --no-neuron-memory \
                 --csv runs/doors-no-memory.csv
```

## Group fitness sharing

Selection is individual by default: a genome is scored on what it did, so a
signal that only helps a neighbour is pure cost to its sender. That is a fitness
property, not a network one, and no architecture fixes it -- which is why
`--fitness-sharing` (and the matching slider) exists as a comparable option
rather than a new default.

The setting blends each genome's score toward the mean of the genomes sharing
its logical world:

```
f' = (1 - s) * f + s * mean(f over the world)
```

At `s = 0` nothing changes; the input is returned unchanged, so the option off
is the old behaviour rather than a reimplementation of it. At `s = 1` a whole
world is scored together, selection acts on groups, and helping a neighbour pays
its sender back. Sharing only redistributes fitness inside a world and never
changes a world's total, so selection pressure between worlds survives at every
setting.

Only selection sees the shared numbers. Reported and plotted fitness stays
individual, because a shared run and an unshared one could not otherwise be
compared on their headline figures: sharing compresses spread by construction.
Objective completion is untouched either way and is the cleanest comparison.

### Sweeping it from the window

Whether sharing helps is an empirical question, and one run cannot answer it.
The **Sharing sweep** panel runs the same experiment once per value -- up to six
stages -- and restarts evolution between them, so a stage measures its own
setting rather than that setting applied to whatever the previous one had
already evolved. Every stage keeps its own curves, and they are plotted on one
shared axis, because separately autoscaled plots would make a flat run and a
climbing one look alike.

Objective completion is plotted first and on a fixed 0..1 axis: it is the one
number sharing does not move arithmetically, so it is the honest comparison
between settings. The last stage is not restarted when it ends -- the run simply
carries on at that setting with every stage kept for reading.

The same comparison from the batch runner, which writes CSV instead of curves:

```sh
for share in 0.0 0.5 1.0; do
  vkneuro_headless --scenario scent --generations 60 --seed 5 \
                   --fitness-sharing "$share" --csv "runs/scent-share-$share.csv"
done
```

Worth running with a non-zero `--signal-cost`. While emitting is free, colour
stays a free drift even under shared fitness: what pays back has to cost
something first.

## Neuron time constants

Every hidden neuron carries its own state and integrates toward its activation
at its own evolved time constant:

```
y += (dt / tau) * (-y + activation)
h  = tanh(y)
```

`tau` is a gene, so how long a neuron remembers is selected for rather than
designed, and different time scales become a trait evolution can separate: a
fast neuron is a reflex that tracks its input within a step, a slow one holds a
fact across seconds. `dt` enters explicitly, so a memory is measured in seconds
and not in steps -- the same rule the rest of the physics follows. A time
constant of half a second closes `1 - 1/e` of the gap to its input in half a
second at 30 Hz, at 60 Hz and at 240 Hz, and the unit test asserts exactly that.

The gene enters a bounded logarithmic range, from one step (16.7 ms) to four
seconds. Logarithmic because what matters about a memory is its order of
magnitude: a linear map would spend most of the gene range between two and four
seconds. A gene of zero lands on the geometric middle, about 260 ms.

This is where memory belongs. The two recurrent cells put it in the *output*
layer, which cost two of the eight output slots and squeezed everything a brain
might remember through a two-number bottleneck; time constants give all twenty
neurons a state and take no output slot at all. The recurrent cells stay --
they are an explicit, inspectable channel -- but they are no longer the only
thing holding the past.

**Ablation.** `tau = dt` makes the update `y = activation` exactly, which is the
memoryless network this replaced, so **Neuron memory** off (or
`--no-neuron-memory`) is literally the old behaviour rather than a
reimplementation of it -- the same code path with one parameter changed, no
second network and no branch around the neuron. Compare the two the same way as
any other ablation:

```sh
for memory in "" "--no-neuron-memory"; do
  vkneuro_headless --scenario scent --generations 60 --seed 5 $memory \
                   --csv "runs/scent-memory${memory:+-off}.csv"
done
```

The genome grew by one gene per hidden neuron and the agent record by one float
per hidden neuron (176 to 256 bytes). Both file formats notice: world snapshots
are at version 3 and reject version 2, and a genome archive from the old brain
is rejected by the weight count it already records -- with a message naming the
counts, which is more use than a version number would be.

## Replay

Watching trained weights is a different job from training them, and the
difference is one flag. **Replay only (no evolution)** scores and reports every
generation exactly as a training run does -- that is how loaded weights get
judged -- and then selects and mutates nothing. The population is left alone, so
the same genomes respawn; the beacon motion seed is the generation number, which
does not advance either, so the next generation is the same run again rather
than a similar one. That repeatability is asserted by `vkneuro_replay_smoke`,
which compares two replayed generations byte for byte.

**Load genomes** takes a `.vkng` archive, which carries weights and nothing
else -- exactly what replaying a champion needs, since the world is whatever is
set up in the window. An archive normally holds one champion or a handful of
elites while a run has a population size fixed when its buffers were made, so
the archive is repeated across the population and every agent on screen runs the
loaded brain. The status line says the repetition happened rather than leaving
it to be inferred from the picture.

To watch a headless champion:

```sh
vkneuro_headless --scenario scent --generations 200 --save-champion runs/scent.vkng
# then in the window: Load genomes -> runs/scent.vkng, tick Replay only
```

A world snapshot (`.vknw`) is the other way in, and carries the arena and every
setting with it; a genome archive keeps the window's current world and changes
only the brain.

The foraging scenario does not grant passive tracking fitness. Reaching the
resource switches an explicit task input from `seek resource` to `seek home`
and fills a cargo-level input. Cargo decays while being carried, so prompt home
delivery is worth more; delivery completes a cycle and switches the task back.
The home teleports to a deterministic random position every eight simulation
seconds, independently for each trial and generation.
Fitness remains cumulative—the expiring cargo is the decreasing reward
potential—so long generations do not erase already completed work. Two separate
learned memory values are fed back as inputs on the next simulation step and
updated by the final two network outputs.

```

The shared contracts are small:

- `SimulationState` carries controls, statistics, the published agent-buffer
  view, and the published viewport image;
- `AgentState` is an explicitly checked 176-byte std430-compatible structure;
- `BrainKernel.inl` is the network preset: sensor block sizes, hidden width and
  output meanings, from which the input capacity, every block offset, the genome
  size and the packed GPU layout are derived. Both languages compile it, so the
  CPU evaluator, the sensor sampler and the shader build the same network from
  one declaration; `Topology` is the C++ view of it and restates nothing. Each
  `ScenarioDefinition` then selects its active input/hidden/output counts;
- module order in `main.cpp` is the composition graph: compute publishes the
  buffer, rendering reads it, and ImGui composites the viewport;
- `GpuStepParameters` carries only what every scenario needs, plus a 48-byte
  `ScenarioParameterBlock` each scenario packs and unpacks itself. It travels in
  a storage buffer indexed by step rather than in push constants, so adding a
  scenario neither widens a shared struct nor approaches the 128-byte push
  constant size Vulkan guarantees;
- `ScenarioDefinition` is the whole contract of an experiment: brain shape,
  beacons, fitness, objective counting, per-step hooks, GPU packing, and the
  tunables the UI should offer. A validated registry replaces what used to be
  scenario switches in the simulation, the scoring, the renderer, the batch
  runner and the UI;
- `FitnessWeights` carries the shaping coefficients to both the CPU reference
  and the shader, so a fitness experiment is a slider or a CLI flag.

This lets a new sensor model, brain evaluator, selection policy, renderer, or
UI replace its counterpart without changing the application lifecycle.

`SimulationDriver` holds the experiment; `SimulationModule` only maps frame
callbacks onto it. The batch runner drives the same driver from an
`ImmediateContext`, so a sweep and the window run identical code.

### Units and the two time bases

`include/vkexp/simulation/Units.hpp` is where the scale is declared and where
the step's two time bases are reconciled. A step is the unit of reproducibility:
replays, archives and parity tests are all indexed by step count, and none of
them depends on wall-clock time. A second is the unit the physics is written in
-- speeds in m/s, drags and decay rates in 1/s -- so that `deltaTime` is a free
parameter rather than a hidden part of the fitness function.

The rule that keeps them consistent: a quantity accumulated over the step is
multiplied by `deltaTime`, and a fraction removed per step is written as
`1 - exp(-rate * dt)`, the form the drags already used. The wall penalty and the
contact solver were the two that broke it, and both were charged per step, which
is why `deltaTime` was pinned at 1/60 and never exposed.

### Where the CPU path fits

The CPU code is not a mirror of the shader. It exists to build the network from
the shared preset, to score a finished generation, and to step and inspect a
single agent -- which the GPU cannot do usefully for 2048 of them at once. What
genuinely differs between the two, the parallel substrate, is verified by tests
that need many agents:

- `runGenomeAddressingProbe` gives six genomes distinctive motor biases and
  checks every agent follows its own; a wrong genome stride or base offset is
  invisible to a single-agent parity test.
- `runMultiAgentDeterminism` and `runAgentInteractionTest` cover the shared
  spatial grid, barriers and logical-world isolation.

### Adding a scenario

One source file fills in a `ScenarioDefinition`, one `worlds/<name>.glsl`
unpacks the same parameter block for geometry, one `worlds/steps/<name>.glsl`
mirrors the step hooks, and one line joins the registry. Shared formulas go in
`include/vkexp/worlds/ScenarioKernel.inl`, which is compiled twice -- once as
C++ through a small `vec2`/`uint` shim, once as GLSL where those names are built
in -- so a hash constant or a beacon formula exists exactly once. The remaining
scenario identity checks live in two GLSL dispatchers, which is as far as a
language without function pointers allows.

The four beacon-following scenarios currently use a reactive `57 -> 20 -> 6`
brain. `Forage + home` and `Scent relay` declare `61 -> 20 -> 8`, adding task
state and two recurrent memory cells. Scenario changes still reset evolution, while the GA
and fixed-capacity GPU genome buffers remain shared.

## CPU/GPU correctness

`vkexp_compute_smoke` creates the same agent and genome on CPU and GPU, advances
both by one complete sensor/network/physics step, reads the SSBO back, and
compares every float with a small tolerance for both world shapes. A two-agent
GPU test verifies physical separation, tactile contact, and reception of an
emitted red signal, then verifies that the same colocated agents cannot collide
or exchange light across a logical-world boundary. Another parity case covers
the exact step at which the active beacon diagonal changes.

On top of that, every scenario runs a 540-step trajectory regression:

- **lockstep parity.** Each step feeds the CPU reference state to the GPU and
  compares one step of both, so the shader is checked at hundreds of genuinely
  reachable states -- including the alternating phase flip and the forage home
  relocation epoch -- without the chaotic drift a free-running trajectory would
  accumulate through tanh feedback.
- **accumulated drift budget.** Lockstep cannot see a systematic bias smaller
  than the per-step tolerance, because resetting to the CPU state each step stops
  it accumulating. Summing the signed per-step differences restores that:
  rounding noise cancels to ~1e-4 over 540 steps, while a changed shader constant
  reaches ~3e-2. The budget sits an order of magnitude above the noise.
- **coverage assertions.** A run whose beacon stayed out of sensor range, or whose
  alternating phase never flipped, fails rather than passing vacuously.
- **determinism.** 192 agents sharing one spatial grid are stepped twice; the
  results must be bit-identical, which is where a grid race would surface.
- **genome addressing.** Six genomes with distinctive motor biases; each agent
  must follow its own. This is the class of bug a single-agent parity test
  structurally cannot see.
- **trail coupling.** A mark is written under one antenna tip and the agent has
  to turn the way that tip is wired. A shader feeding every tip the same cell
  passes every other test and fails this one.
- **reconfiguration.** The arena size, the group size and the trail resolution
  are walked through the real driver, with a generation run after each change.
  These resize GPU buffers under a running simulation, and a stale descriptor
  there faults the device rather than returning a wrong number, so the test
  carries a timeout as part of its assertion.
- **step-rate independence.** An agent is driven into a wall and held there for
  two simulated seconds at 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 Hz. The accumulated penalty
  has to stay within 25% of the 60 Hz value while the step count changes 16x,
  and has to stay closer to it than the step-count ratio would put it -- the
  second half is what fails if an accumulator goes back to counting steps.

Pure CPU tests cover world scaling, beacon layouts, logical-world partition
mapping, channel mapping, weight layout, neural evaluation, elite preservation,
scenario parameter packing, resolved step settings, genome archive round-trips
including corruption and truncation rejection, and reusable compute validation.
Several guard the contracts this architecture rests on: every registered scenario
is checked for registry order, a CLI key, a brain that fits the genome, a declared
beacon count that matches what it reports, and a step that survives its own hooks;
the shared scenario kernel is pinned on the C++ side so a change to
`ScenarioKernel.inl` cannot slip through on a machine without a GPU; and the brain
preset is checked by derivation rather than by snapshot -- the sensor blocks must
tile the input vector without gaps or overlaps, so adding a sensor stays a
one-line edit instead of a test rewrite.

## Build and run

Requirements: CMake 3.24+, Ninja, a C++20 compiler, Vulkan 1.3 development
files and driver, GLFW 3.3+, `glslangValidator`, and X11/Wayland for the GUI.
Dear ImGui v1.91.8 is fetched by CMake.

```bash
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug --output-on-failure
./build/debug/vulkan_neuroevolution_agents
```

Disable validation if the validation layer is unavailable:

```bash
./build/debug/vulkan_neuroevolution_agents --no-validation
```

### Batch runs

`vkneuro_headless` evolves without a window, which is what makes overnight runs,
parameter sweeps and ablation comparisons possible:

```bash
./build/release/vkneuro_headless --scenario rotating --generations 200 \
    --csv runs/rotating.csv --save-champion runs/rotating-champion.vkng

# Signal-off ablation against the same seed.
./build/release/vkneuro_headless --scenario forage --generations 200 --seed 7 \
    --no-agent-light --csv runs/forage-nolight.csv

# Resume a saved population.
./build/release/vkneuro_headless --scenario forage --generations 50 \
    --load-population runs/forage-population.vkng

# Save and resume a whole experiment, not just its weights. The snapshot carries
# the scenario, arena and every physics setting, so the resume restates none of
# them.
./build/release/vkneuro_headless --scenario scent --generations 40 \
    --save-world runs/scent.vknw
./build/release/vkneuro_headless --generations 40 --load-world runs/scent.vknw
```

Fitness shaping coefficients are flags too (`--objective-bonus`, `--motor-cost`,
`--tracking-reward`, `--signal-cost`, `--energy-drain`, `--fitness-sharing`), so
sweeping them needs no rebuild:

```bash
for reward in 0.0 0.25 0.75; do
    ./build/release/vkneuro_headless --scenario rotating --generations 50 --seed 5 \
        --tracking-reward "$reward" --csv "runs/tracking-$reward.csv"
done
```

`--help` lists every option, and its scenario list comes from the registry.
Genome archives are versioned little-endian files
that record the generation, scenario, seed, fitness and brain shape, and refuse
to load into a build with a different weight count.

A world snapshot (`.vknw`) is the heavier sibling: the population, where every
agent stands, the generation and step it was on, and every physics setting,
which is what lets a resume start mid-generation with no flags. It is equally
strict, rejecting a file written for a different brain topology, agent layout or
settings list, and a population or trial count the running process cannot hold,
since both are buffer dimensions fixed at startup. The trail field is
deliberately excluded: it is device-local, up to 256 MiB, and derived -- a
couple of half-lives of stepping rebuilds it, which costs less than storing it.
The interactive build has the same thing under **Snapshot** in the control
panel.

The debug suite contains pure unit tests, CLI smoke tests, two short real
headless evolution runs covering the archive round trip, and a headless Vulkan
parity test. The Vulkan-dependent ones return CTest's skip code when no compute
device exists.

## Extension points

The next world feature should enter through a focused contract:

- a new scenario adds one `.cpp`, two `.glsl` files and a registry line; it does
  not touch the shared step parameters, the simulation, the scoring or the UI;
- a new sensor channel is a line in the network preset; offsets, genome size and
  both implementations follow;
- a new accumulated cost or reward is written per second, so it does not silently
  become a function of the step rate;
- walls and occlusion extend sensor/world queries;
- richer recurrent cells or gated memory can extend the two-value recurrent state;
- the neuron model is one shared integrator, so a gated unit would replace that
  function rather than the loop around it;
- internal walls and occlusion extend grid-backed world queries;
- colony scoring replaces fitness aggregation without changing physics;
- a different topology can become another evaluator/shader pair;
- GPU-side evolution can later replace the synchronous generation boundary.
